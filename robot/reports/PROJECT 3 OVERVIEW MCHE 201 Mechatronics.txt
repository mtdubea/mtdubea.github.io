PROJECT 3 OVERVIEW: MCHE 201 Mechatronics Avatar Robot Project
Course: Introduction to Mechanical Design and Mechatronics  
School: University of Louisiana at Lafayette  
Semester: Sophomore Year  
Team: Team 4  

üèóÔ∏è PROJECT SUMMARY:
- Designed and fabricated an autonomous robot themed after James Cameron's *Avatar*.
- Mission: Complete 5 complex tasks autonomously on a custom competition track using Python-controlled microcontroller.
- Design constraints: ‚â§18" tall, 12"x24" base, must fit in regulation ‚Äúbox‚Äù before each run, 30 sec runtime, no damage to track or other bots.
- Task scoring included: Knock 4 Toy Soldiers, Collect 4 Na‚Äôvi Lego Men, Collect 6 Fauna, Collect 3 Banshees, Rescue Jake Sully & Neytiri.

üèÜ PERFORMANCE & OUTCOME:
- Placed 10th out of 13 teams in live multi-team trial due to in-game interference and false starts.
- Scored **1st place for design and functionality** during judged evaluation prior to head-to-head competition.

üß† ROLE & RESPONSIBILITIES (Matthew):
- Led mechanical design, fabrication, and system integration of components.
- Developed and refined Python code for all motion and sensor operations.
- Responsible for wiring, sensor mounting, and component testing.
- Hosted all team build sessions and optimized system continuously.

‚öôÔ∏è CUSTOM HARDWARE INTEGRATION:
- MCHE201 Microcontroller board (12V DC, Python programmable).
- Large DC gearmotor for drive.
- Stepper motor for high-torque, low-speed actions.
- Linear actuator and solenoid for rescue task mechanisms.
- IR distance sensor and magnetic proximity switch for task triggers.

üß© UNIQUE FEATURES:
- Custom overhead boom with telescoping linear actuator to reach spinning platform and rescue Banshees.
- Magnetically-triggered rescue mechanism for Jake Sully and Neytiri figurines.
- PID-tuned stepper logic to precisely position arm without overshoot.
- Strategic weight and footprint reduction to comply with regulation dimensions.

üîß ENGINEERING CHALLENGES:
- False triggering before timer start disqualified some teams; our reset strategy recovered eligibility in time.
- Tight tolerance compliance with box constraints required iterative redesign.
- Sensors required shielding to avoid ambient interference.

üß™ ENGINEERING TOOLS & DOCUMENTATION:
- Created detailed **House of Quality**, **Function Tree**, **Evaluation Matrix**, **Specification Sheet**, and component layout diagrams.
- Wrote modular Python scripts: `main.py`, `motor.py`, `actuator.py`, `LinAct.py`, `stepper.py`, etc.
- Used blue-themed aesthetic and physical design for visibility and thematic cohesion.

üìÇ AVAILABLE FILES (as of last working state):
- Final report PDF and presentation.
- House of Quality, Function Tree, Spec Sheet (image-based).
- `main.py`, `motor.py`, `stepper.py`, `LinAct.py`, `actuator.py`, `pca9685.py`.

üìå KEY TERMS:
- IR Sensor = Infrared Distance Sensor
- FSR = Force Sensitive Resistor
- PID = Proportional-Integral-Derivative control
- Na‚Äôvi, Banshees = Figurines as scoring targets in the Avatar theme

üìÑ RESUME BULLET EXAMPLE:
Led design and integration of Python-controlled autonomous robot using DC, stepper, and actuator motors; earned 1st place in judged design scoring for full autonomous functionality and engineering quality across 5-task competition.
