      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Mechanical Engineering graduate from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette with a strong foundation in CAD/FEA, DFM/DFA, Lean, and root cause analysis.
        My projects demonstrate hands-on application of engineering design and manufacturing—from precision-machined assemblies to autonomous control systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        With experience in industrial fieldwork, lab testing, and automation, I focus on delivering practical solutions, system efficiency, and performance optimization.
        I'm currently pursuing the FE certification and plan to obtain PE licensure while building a portfolio of professional and entrepreneurial engineering projects.

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        I'm working toward a long-term career in mechanical systems design and optimization, including roles in R&D, manufacturing, and process improvement. I intend to gain early experience at companies known for engineering excellence—such as Tesla or The Boring Company—before ultimately building my own engineering business focused on innovation and lean solutions.
