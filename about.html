    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m a Mechanical Engineering graduate from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette with a strong foundation in
      CAD/FEA (CSWA certified), manufacturing processes, process improvement, and field integration. My work has spanned
      across engineering design projects, shop-floor execution, and plant support â€” with a focus on merging theory with hands-on results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key projects include a first-place senior race trike (Acadiana 500), an autonomous robot, and a mechatronics sensor payload system.
      I specialize in SolidWorks design, TIG/CNC fabrication, FEA stress validation, and implementing Lean/PFMEA strategies for
      real-world reliability.
