      <h2>Matthew Dubea</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a Mechanical Engineering graduate from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, driven by curiosity, hands-on problem solving, and practical innovation. 
        From working in chemical plants to welding frames for race tricycles, I blend analytical knowledge with field-tested grit.
      </p>

      <p>
        My core strengths include CAD design (SolidWorks Certified), FEA analysis, fabrication (TIG, CNC), PFMEA, Six Sigma, and mechanical troubleshooting. I strive to engineer real-world solutions that are manufacturable, efficient, and robust.
      </p>

      <p>
        Iâ€™ve also developed projects involving Python automation, Arduino/MCU controls, and engineering data analysis â€” and aim to continue growing in both mechanical and digital toolsets.
      </p>

      <p>
        My long-term vision is to move from engineering contributor to entrepreneur â€” combining engineering, land investment, and automation to build self-sustaining systems that create both value and freedom.
